# wordle-bot

Automated [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) bot that does not use Wordle page source (e.g. the future solutions list and allowed guesses list found on the Wordle site) in any way. Uses a modified version of [The Stanford GraphBase's](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html) list of 5-letter words. Words are removed from `sgb.txt` on the fly as invalid words are discovered.

## Description

`wordle-bot` essentially plays using Bayesian inference, generating 2 guesses for each row: one that it deems optimal for gathering information about the search space (exploration) and one that it deems optimal for getting the right answer given the all the information it knows (exploitation). `wordle-bot` does not perform any kind of tree searching.

The exploration guess is generated by assigning a score to each valid word in the search space and higher scores are given to words that contain more frequently-occurring letters. Additionally, words that contain repetitive, nonnovel information are punished according to a hyperparameter. The exploitation guess is generated by maximizing the probability over all valid guesses of each letter being in its position given all previously seen information.

If the exploitation guess's probability is larger than a theshold, then `wordle-bot` uses it as its guess for the current row and otherwise, it uses the exploration guess. The threshold decays on every subsequent row in an exponential fashion and the initial threshold and the rate of decay are hyperparameters.

## Usage

Must be using Python 3.8 or later. To get started, run
```
